# Digi Royal Conferences
individual project using only CSS/HTML (exept for one line to close the popupmenu when choosing a link). Done as part of a Frontendedeveloper program at Folkuniversitet, Karlstad. 

The project set out to create a website for a fictional Conference taking place in Karlstad, Sweden. 
The page should present 10 Seminars, and the possibility to book your attendance. You should be able to book just for the day or more, and also choose what food you like and tell if you have any allergies.

My goal for the project was to create a large landingpage contain smaller sections of the conference. I came up with the brandname DigiRoyal Confereces and hence the name i chose to 
give the page a purple color-scheme. Purple standing for magic and royalty etc.
